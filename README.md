# BTech Academic Performance Dashboard â€“ Power BI

This is a personal Power BI project I created to visualize and analyze my academic performance across all 8 semesters of my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering. It was also my first serious dive into Power BI â€” an incredibly powerful and beginner-friendly tool for turning raw data into interactive, visual insights.

## What I Learned

Before starting this project, I had never used Power BI. Through this journey, I learned:

- How to connect and clean data from Excel
- How to write DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to build custom KPIs
- How to use slicers and filters to make interactive reports
- How to create trend visuals that reflect real academic progress

This hands-on experience gave me a deep appreciation for data storytelling and how powerful visuals can make analysis more intuitive and impactful.

## Project Highlights

Even though I started with zero knowledge, I built a complete dashboard that includes:

- **Cards** showing:
  - Total Study Hours
  - Average GPA
  - Attendance %
  - Consistency Score (based on standard deviation of study hours)
  - GPA Delta (change compared to previous semester)
  
- **GPA Trend Chart** â€“ Line chart showing GPA progression over semesters

- **Study Time Matrix** â€“ Matrix showing study hours per subject per day (used instead of heatmaps)

- **Bar Chart** â€“ Visualizing attendance by subject

- **Donut Chart** â€“ Time spent per subject breakdown

- ðŸŽ›**Interactive Filters Panel** â€“ Slicers for Semester, Subject, Study Method, and Date Range

Every visual is interactive and updates based on selected filters, allowing a third party (or myself) to drill down into my academic efforts semester-by-semester.

## How to Use

1. Download the `.pbix` file
2. Open it in [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)
3. Explore the dashboard using slicers and visuals

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Stands Out

- It goes beyond basic charts and builds a **full report** with custom measures and interactivity
- Shows **self-tracked** academic data â€” making it deeply personal and meaningful
- Uses DAX to build insightful metrics like Attendance % and Study Consistency
- Built completely from scratch, showcasing not just visualization but **analytical thinking**

## Built With

- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (STDEVX.P)
- Excel (as data source)
